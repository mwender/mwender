Via my company [Wenmark Digital Solutions](https://wenmarkdigital.com), I serve as webmaster for my clients. My specialty is building WordPress-powered websites that utilize [Elementor](https://elementor.com/) as a page builder. This allows for collaboration between myself and my clients' in-house marketing teams. They rely on me to buildout pages and features beyond their grasp while allowing them to maintain the content on their sites.

I'm also a founding member of the [Webmaster Backup Alliance](https://webmasterbackupalliance.com/). We connect webmasters for reciprocal support between small to mid-sized web development agencies.
